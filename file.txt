I am working with reactflow and want to implement a feature that allows users to create new canvas pages, for example I could be working on canvas A and then click create new and be presented with a brand new canvas while keeping the state of the old canvas intact and the other canvas accessible using a tab. How do you suggest this is done. I am attaching the files for the zustand store, My assumption is that this store will need to be duplicated like using a factory to avoid having massive amounts of complexity within a single store. Regarding the new canvas perhaps a new route. But please review all this and correct me if I am wrong I am open to suggestions and seek the highest critique to ensure my product is well done
